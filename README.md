# SnapShop frontend
On the backend, SnapShop uses the Genome Link API to connect users with products and user-generated content most relevant to their phenotypes. For example, for a user with sensitive skin and fair skin tone, only certain sunscreens may work well. Therefore, this user should be suggested content with favorable reviews by those with the same phenotype (sensitive, fair skin). This improves shopping convenience and can deliver insights that are only possible through genome data (vitamin/protein/carbohydrate absorption, fast/slow twitch muscle fiber composition, etc.)
